# Probabilistic_Distribution_of_Human_Events

Secular Karma.

In this project, I aim to mimic and model the humans, their actions, and possible consequences. While religiously this is conceptualized under Karma, I aim to formulate a secular and statistical model of human events. Through digital human programs, embedded with base personalities, under certain external conditions, I aim to create a set comprising of human actions, their reactions, assigning a probability to each. I can even derive my custom action-reaction possibilities, by altering the initial conditions.This can help in human behaviour prediction.

Pleasse refer to the attached pdf document, [Secular Karma](https://github.com/arahant/Probabilistic_Distribution_of_Human_Events/blob/master/docs/Probabilistic_Karma.pdf) where I have laid out a detailed theoretical background and explained the implementation
