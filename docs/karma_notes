Karma, also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the principle of karma, sometimes as the karma theory or the law of karma. Karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings, arising from the diversity of views from Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and other traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. Therefore, different schools of Indologists derive different definitions for the karma concept from ancient Indian literature. However, all these Karmic theories share certain common concepts: Causality, Ethicization and Rebirth.

Paraphrasing from Wikipedia, "... The relationship of Karma to Causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thought. The theory of karma as causality holds that the intentions and executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life (s)he lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions.

Another causality characteristic, shared by Karmic theories, is that like deeds lead to like effects. Thus good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral or emotional - that is, one's karma affects one's happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one's current life, and in some schools, it extends to future lives..."

Paraphrasing from Wikipedia, "...The second theme common to karma theories is Ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence, which will come to fruition in either this or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual's present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself "reward and punishment", but the law that produces consequence. Good karma is considered as dharma and leads to merit, while bad karma is considered adharma and leads to sin.

Reichenbach suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. In ethics, one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter in the evaluation of one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory..."

Paraphrasing from Wikipedia, "The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation. Rebirth is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma.he cycle reach the realm of gods, those who don't continue in the cycle..."
